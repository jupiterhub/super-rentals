# Jupiter's Conclusion 
The whole tutorial from the Ember site is useful to cover different cases and discusses core concepts of ember.
The writing could've been easier by writing codes only on-demand (some codes will make sens only 2 chapters later).
Nonetheless developing in Ember is complete, quick and intuitive (specially with the CLI creating classes for you)

Chapters covered are
 * Routing
 * Templates
 * Adapters
 * Helpers (Component / Hash)
 * Components
 * Mirage
 * DataStore
 * Ember Data
 * JSON API
 * Ember Inflector Rules
 * Acceptance Test
  * ES2015 (former ES6)
  * Controllers
  * Map Integration
  * Ember Concurrency
  * Integration Test
  * Wait Helper
  * RSVP(resolve promise)
  * Ember Observer
  * Service
  * Injections
  * Unit Test (this.on)
  * Nested Routes
  * Bonus: Node/Surge along the way.
